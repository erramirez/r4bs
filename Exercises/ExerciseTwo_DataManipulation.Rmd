```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Try to complete the following:

1. Start with the data frames you created in exercise one. 
    a) p01 - p05 daily activity data
    b) demographic data
    c) step goals data
2. Combine into one data set with all available variables from each file
3. Create two new variables:
    a) `goaldiff`: difference between the `TotalSteps` and `goalsteps` for each day, each participant
    b) `MVPAguide`: set to "TRUE" if 30min or more of MVPA is met, "FALSE" if <30min
