Exercise Two: Data Manipulation
================

Try to complete the following:

1.  Start with the data frames you created in exercise one.
    1.  p01 - p05 daily activity data
    2.  demographic data
    3.  step goals data
2.  Combine into one data set with all available variables from each file
3.  Create two new variables:
    1.  `goaldiff`: difference between the `TotalSteps` and `goalsteps` for each day, each participant
    2.  `MVPAguide`: set to "TRUE" if 30min or more of MVPA is met, "FALSE" if &lt;30min
